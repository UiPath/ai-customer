  "description": "This model was open sourced by ONNX. The model predicts the answer to a question based on some paragraph context. A common use case is in KYC or processing financial reports where a common question can be applied to a standard set of documents. It is based on the state-of-the-art BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The model applies Transformers, a popular attention model, to language modelling to produce an encoding of the input and then trains on the task of question answering. The implementation is open sourced by the license here: https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/master/LICENSE",
