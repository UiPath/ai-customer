    "description": "This is a generic, retrainable deep learning model to perform Object Detection. This ML Package is pretrained on COCO Dataset so you can directly create an ML Skill which can be used for identifying 80 classes of COCO Dataset. You can also train it on your own data and create an ML Skill and use for performing object detection where it will now work on your data. This deep learning model uses You only look once (YOLO) which a state-of-the-art and one of the most effective object detection algorithms that also encompasses many of the most innovative ideas evolving from the field of computer vision.",
