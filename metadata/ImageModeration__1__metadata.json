    "description": "This is a model for image content moderation based on a deep learning architecture commonly referred to as Inception V3. Given an image, the model will output one of four classes \"explicit\", \"explicit-drawing\", \"neutral\", and \"pornographic\" together with a normalized confidence score for each class probability. The original is based on the paper ''Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision'' by Szegedy et al which was open-sourced by Google.",
