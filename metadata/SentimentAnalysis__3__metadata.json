  "description": "This model was open sourced by Facebook Research. It predicts the sentiment of a text in English Language. Possible predictions are one of \"Very Negative\", \"Negative\", \"Neutral\", \"Positive\", \"Very Positive\". The model was trained on amazon product review data thus, the model predictions may have some unexpected results for different data distributions. A common use case is to route unstructured language content (e.g. emails) to an appropriate responder based on the sentiment of the text.
